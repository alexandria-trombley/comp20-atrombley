A. What is the purpose of this Git repository?

The purpose of this Git repository was to store work throughout the semester where others could not access our code. However, by creating a gh-pages branch, we were able to see the rendered pages in a web browser. This allowed us to uphold academic integrity stamdards while also being able to share our final products. 

B. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

Overall, I thought the labs and assignments were really well planned such that they taught us something while not being completely over our heads. I think my favorite assignment was developing client-side mapchat. Throughout the course it was always quite clear how what we were learning could be applied to the real world, but this assignment was the first time I felt like I had built something useful and functional, and that was very fun. Also, this was the one assignment where I went in feeling like I knew a little bit about how to do the project, which made it enjoyable!

C. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I feel as though I have grown in a couple of ways throughout the semester. Obviously, I have learned so much about web programming--I came into the semester not knowing anything on the subject other than how to design an aesthetically-pleasing user interface. But I also feel like I grew as a learner. As annoying as it was sometimes to have no idea how to execute a project, I was able to find the information I needed online, and from my peers, professor and TA's. In the end I feel like I learned the information more thoroughly--I never found studying for quizzes to be difficult because I had learned the information through working hard on the projects. Finally, I also feel as though I grew as a technical manager. I have a strong foundation in human factors engineering, but being the COO of a technically-oriented social impact comapny requires a base understanding of how computers communicate and store data, which I definitely gained this semester. This has already helped me manage a team of developers, and I am sure it will become even more useful down the road. 

D. What was the most important thing you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
