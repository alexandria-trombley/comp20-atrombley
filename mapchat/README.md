1) Identify which parts of the assignment have been properly implemented.

	I believe that all aspects of this project have been implemented correctly. The program locates the 
	user and places them on the map as well as sending the user's data to the 'super secret' API, 
	retrieving the information of all of the other students, and placing them on the map. Everyone on the 
	map has an appropriate marker and information box. 

2) Identify anyone with whom you collaborated or discussed the assignment.

	No one. Used only the examples given by Ming.

3) How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

	Approximately 11 hours.


NOTE: I originally did the project in a folder under the name "proj2." When I reviewed the assignment, I realized it had to be named "mapchat." I copied all of my documents into a folder properly named "mapchat;" however, it does not show all of the commits I did while working on the project. To see these, look at my "proj2."
