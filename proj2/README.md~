1) Identify which parts of the assignment have been properly implemented.

	I believe that all aspects of this project have been implemented correctly. The program locates the 
	user and places them on the map as well as sending the user's data to the 'super secret' API, 
	retrieving the information of all of the other students, and placing them on the map. Everyone on the 
	map has an appropriate marker and information box.
