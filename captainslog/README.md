A. Identift the aspects of the work that have been correctly implemented.

	All parts of this assignment are implemented correctly. The program looks for a 
	file in local storage called "messages." If it does not exist, it sets this file later in 
	the control of the program. It prints out the stored messages, takes in a
	new message, prints it to the screen with the old messages, and stores all of
	these new and old messages in the local storage.

B. Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated with or discussed the assignment.

	Ming helped me find the correct jquery action to change the content of an 
	HTML id selector.

C. Say how many hours you spent on this assignment.

	Approximately 2 hours.
